Description:
    Generates a Publisher/Handler pair

Example:
    rails generate dispatch_rider:job some_job

    This will create:
        app/publishers/some_job_publisher.rb
        app/handlers/some_job.rb

    As well as its tests (currently only supporting rspec):
        spec/publishers/some_job_publisher_spec.rb
        spec/handlers/some_job_spec.rb
